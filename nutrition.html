                        people need different macronutrient rations than others.

                        Proteins provide 4 calories per gram. <br /> Poteins are vital for processes like cell
                        signaling, immune function and building of tissues, hormones and enzymes. <br /> It's recommend
                        that proteins comprise 10-35% of your total
                        calorie intake. <br /> However, protein recommendations vary depending on body composition
                        goals, age, health and more.
                        <br /> Examples of protein rich foods include eggs, poulty, fish, tofu.

                    <p>
                        Carbohydrates include sugars, starches and fibres. <br /> Most types of carbs get broken down
                        into glucose, or blood sugar, which your body either uses for immediate energy or stores as
                        glycogen - the storage form of glucose -
                        in your liver. <br /> Carbs provide 4 calories per gram and typically make up the largest
                        portion of people's calorie intake. <br /> Carbs intake is among the most hotly debated of all
                        macronutrients recommendations, most major
                        health organizations suggest consuming 45-65% of your daily calories from carbs. <br />
                        Carbohydrates are found in foods like grains, starchy vegetables, beans, dairy products and
                        fruits.

                    <p>
                        Fats have the most calories of all macronutrients, providing 9 calories per gram. <br /> Your
                        body needs fat for energy and critical functions, such as hormone production, nutrient
                        absorption and body temperature maintenance. <br /> Though typical macronutrients
                        recommendations for fats range from 20-35% of total calories, many people find success following
                        a diet higher in fat. <br /> Fats are found in foods like oils, butter, avocado, nuts, meat and
                        fatty
                        fish.

                    <p>
                        Vitamins are organic substances present in minute amounts in natural foodstuffs. <br /> Having
                        too little of any particular vitamin may increase the risk of developing certain health issues.
                        <br /> A vitamin is an organic compound,
                        which means that it contains carbon. <br /> It is also an essential nutrient that the body may
                        need to get from food. <br /> There are currently 13 recognised vitamins. <br /> Vitamins are
                        either soluble, or dissolvable, in fat
                        or water:

                    <h2>Fat-Soluble Vitamins</h2>
                    <p>
                        Vitamins A, D, E, and K are Fat-Soluble. <br /> Fat-Soluble vitamins in fatty tissues and the
                        liver, and reserves of these vitamins can stay in the body for days and sometimes months. <br />
                    </p>
                    <h2>Water-Soluble Vitamins</h2>
                    <p>
                        Vitamins C and all the B vitamins are water-soluble. <br /> Water-Soluble vitamins do not stay
                        trusted sources in the body for long and cannot be stored.
                        <br /> They leave the body via the urine. <br /> Because of this, people need a more regular
                        supply of water-soluble vitamins than fat-soluble ones.

                        Minerals are important for our body to stay healthy. <br /> Your body uses minerals for many
                        different jobs, including keeping your bones, muscles, heart, and brain working properly. <br />
                        Minerals are also important for making
                        enzymes and hormones.
                        <br /> There are two kind of minerals: <br /> Macrominerals are needed in larger amounts, they
                        include calcium, phosphorus, magnesum, sodium, potassium, chloride and sulfur.
                        <br /> Trace minerals are needed in smaller amounts. <br /> They include iron, manganese,
                        copper, iodine, zinc, cobalt, fluoride and selenium. <br /> Most people get the amount of
                        minerals they need by eating a wide variety of
                        foods. <br /> In some cases, your doctor may recommed a mineral supplement.

                    <p>
                        Water is of major importance to all living things; <br /> In some organisms, up to 90% of their
                        body weight comes from water. <br /> Up to 60% of the human adult body is water. <br />
                        According to H.H Mitchell, journal of biological
                        chemistry 158, the brain and heart are composed of 73% water, and the lungs are about 83% water.
                        <br /> The skin contains 64% water, muscles and kidneys are 79%, and even the bones are watery:
                        31%.
                        <br /> Each day humans must consume a certain amount of water to survive.
                        <br /> Of course, this varies according to age and gender, and also by where someone lives.
                        <br /> generally, an adult male needs about 3 litres per day while an adult female needs about
                        2.2 litres per day. <br /> All of the water
                        a person needs does not have to come from drinking liquids, as some of this water is contained
                        in the food we eat.
